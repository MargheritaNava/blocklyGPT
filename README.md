## [Integrating ChatGPT with Blockly for End-User Development of Robot Tasks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3610978.3640653)

This paper presents an End-User Development environment for collaborative robot programming, which integrates Open AI ChatGPT with Google Blockly. Within this environment, a user, who is neither expert in robotics nor in computer programming, can define the items characterizing the application domain (e.g., objects, actions, and locations) and define pick-and-place tasks involving these items. Task definition can be achieved with a combination of natural language and block-based interaction, which exploits the computational capabilities of ChatGPT and the graphical interaction features offered by Blockly, to check the correctness of generated robot programs and modify them through direct manipulation.
